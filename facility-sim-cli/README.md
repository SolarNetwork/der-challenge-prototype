# SolarNetwork DER Challenge: Facility Simulator

This repository contains a proof-of-concept Protobuf/gRPC based server implementation of the
`DerFacility` defined in [der_facility_service][der_facility_service].

## Building

	$ ../gradlew build

This will generate a `build/libs/esi-simple-facility-simulator-cli-X.jar` where `X` is a version number.

## Running
