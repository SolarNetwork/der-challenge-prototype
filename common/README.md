# SolarNetwork DER Challenge: Shared Code

This repository contains common shared code to help across all ESI projects.

## Building

Gradle is used for building. Run the `build` task via `gradlew`:

	$ ../gradlew build

This will generate a `build/libs/esi-common-X.jar` where `X` is a version number.
